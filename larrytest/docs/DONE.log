DONE:
	$ posting to hours should refresh the page with the updated information
	$ generate current date and duration
	maybe have the time be a time selection module if it exists
	$ ability to remove a record
	$ reusing the name if the record table exists
	$ add Y/N checkboxes for emergency, remote 

	NEXT THING:
	$ add up/down arrows to records
	$ learn to make dynamic dropdown fieldset for adding records in specific places
	$ automatically adjust times in subsequent records
	$ http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_navbar_collapse&stacked=h

	NEXT:
	$ finish passing parsedRecords into template
	$ wire template to access parsedRecords for filling in start/end times
	$ wire submit buttons to properly pass information back (figuring out how to insert a record in the middle of the list)
	plan:
		$ add current record to a list of records (split up into fields)
			$ the addition is based on which record's buttons were clicked on
		$ shift the time of everything after that point in the list by the duration amount of the new record
		$ ex: records = [[1, 10:00, 11:00, 1.0], [2, 11:00, 12:15, 1.25]]
			$ click on 1's down arrow...
			$ add [3, 11:00, 12:00, 1.0] // figure out ids or something
			$ records = [[1, 10:00, 11:00, 1.0], [3, 11:00, 12:00, 1.0], [2, 12:00, 13:15, 1.25]]

			
	$ maybe: field for retrieving existing record log (in case of browser closing, for example)
		$ may just require setting the name cookie and refreshing page (also hiding that field if successful)

	$ maybe fix accordion animation (now that it uses a custom js function for opening and closing)

	$ add time checks for splicing in a record
		$ if start time is before previous record's, then take time from previous
		$ if end time is after next record's, then take time from next

	$ move billable/emergency to the bottom of the form, since they are rarely changed

	$ might need to create functions:
		$ modifyStartTime
		$ modifyEndTime
			$ these can call modifyDuration or something


	$ migrate to using Record class in src, template, etc.
