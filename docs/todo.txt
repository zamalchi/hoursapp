for Wednesday/Thursday:

account app:
	[done] beta route --> alpha
	[done] groups:
		generator script
		sort alphabetically
		`getent group | grep sched`


sinfo:
	sort by times?


hours app:
	refactor for organization (take some time to do it)
		 hours_panel_heading : pretty much done
		 hours_panel_body : need to do
		 hours_js_functions : continue refining
		 css pages : organize during and after the templates
	ideas
		clicking on the completed end time resets to a pending duration
		email (to sb) for interns (which supplies subtotal subject line)
	sb
		change billable/emergency to be onclick toggles that change ('Y'/'N') spans



hoursapp:
	add crypto hash generation
	[done] replace email button with post button
		posts to separate bottle server
		      each user runs their own crypto bottle server on a specific port (on the hosting server) ?? ask sb if still confused
		      authenticates hash and receives records

	things to figure out:
	       python version 2.6 vs 2.7
	       using modules on the cluster
	       which python hashing module to use
	       sending data from one app (localhost) to another (cluster)
	       
	[done] fix bug where duration is inputed as a non-number and crashes the server

	[done] make program conscious of project root directory (may be worth putting in the template)

	clean up after messing with crypto
	      remove old code
	      [done] make sure gitignore files are set

	show progress to sb

	[done] change location of address:port for crypto server
	       move from flag in launcher.sh/run.py
	       make inputs in the hours app header (next to send button)

	[done] allow billable/emergency to be focused and toggled via space

	merge sb's changes on master at some point
	      read his updates? wherever they are
	      get new labels.txt

	add some sort of check that a new record doesn't start before the start of the previous one
	    or (if inserting into the list somewhere) that it doesn't end after the end of the next one
	    - match against default pattern
	    - then, onchange, check if it exeeds data-min or data-max
	    - check for in backend
	    - add a note-index or retry-index cookie or something
	      - use it to 1) open the collapse panel on document ready
	      - and 2) place the notes (upon failed record submission) into the correct form's notes field
	    - figure out why an empty end time is being received as "0***" (where is the 0 coming from and where does it set the pending char '***')


	[done] labels regex based on labels file
